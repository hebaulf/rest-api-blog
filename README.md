# Rest API - Blog
For this guide I decided to follow tutorials on creating an open blog application where multiple users can add blog posts.  
  
You can:
- Register as a new user
- Log in
- Click on the user profile in the header.
- Update user image, name, email and password (For now you have to update/write in input for every item otherwise the info will update as blank)
- Create a blog post with image, title and text.
- Edit and delete your blog post.
- View your and other users posts.
  
Passwords are hashed.
