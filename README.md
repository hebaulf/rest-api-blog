# Rest API - Blog
For this guide I decided to follow tutorials on creating an open blog application where multiple users can add blog posts.

</p>

<br>

## Project Setup:
- MERN stack
- Set up with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).
- Rest API with MongoDB
- Heroku deployment 

<br>
  
## Try these functionalities on the website
- Register as a new user
- Log in
- Click on the user profile in the header.
- Update user image, name, email and password (For now you have to update all inputs, otherwise the info will update as blank (did not have time to fix))
- Create a blog post with image, title and text.
- Edit and delete your blog post.
- View your and other users posts.

FYI - Passwords are hashed.
